              Hi! I'm Neev Ahuja, a passionate web developer and tech enthusiast currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering at GTBIT. I specialize in building modern, responsive, and user-friendly web applications using the latest technologies.

            <p>
              I enjoy working on both frontend and backend development, creating seamless user experiences with clean and efficient code. Whether itâ€™s designing interactive UI components or developing robust backend systems, I love turning ideas into functional digital solutions.
  
            </p>
  
            <p>
  
              Currently, I'm exploring full-stack development and improving my skills in UI/UX design to build even better, more intuitive web applications.
  
              When I'm not coding, you can find me experimenting with new frameworks, optimizing performance, or learning about the latest trends in web development.
